Good commands to know:

linux:
ifconfig (interface) down - disables interface
ifconfig (interface) hw ether (new mac address) - makes interface have a new mac address - mac addresses look like this 00:11:22:33:44:55 (6 segments of two characters)
ifconfig (interface) up - enables interface

python:
subprocess.call(command) - runs system commands
subprocess.call("command", shell = true) - better example
subprocess.check_output - check output of code


PyCharm:
ctrl+d = duplicate line;
ctrl+/ = comment line
